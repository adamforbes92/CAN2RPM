# CAN2RPM
CAN2RPM is based on an ESP32 and is designed to provide an RPM signal for traditional coil based ignition systems.  It is perfect for conversions that don't have a dedicated RPM output and instead output RPM via. CAN.

It is a very lightweight module and is similar to Can2Cluster, but has considerably less functionality (RPM output ONLY).
