# CAN2RPM
Based on an ESP32, CAN2RPM is designed to provide an RPM signal for traditional coil based ignition systems.

It is perfect for conversions that don't have a dedicated RPM output and instead output via. CAN.

It is a very lightweight module and is similar to Can2Cluster, but has considerably less functionality (RPM output ONLY).
